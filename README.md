# 🔐 Login & Registration System | C++, OOP, File Handling

This project is a **console-based user authentication system** built in **C++**, demonstrating the use of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles and **file handling** to simulate real-world login and registration functionality.

## 📌 Features

- ✅ **User Sign-Up** – Allows users to register with username, email, and password
- 🔐 **Login Validation** – Authenticates users by verifying entered credentials
- ❓ **Password Recovery** – Recovers password by verifying username and email
- 💾 **Persistent Storage** – Stores data in a custom-delimited `.txt` file using `fstream`

---

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- C++ File Handling (`fstream`)
- Object-Oriented Programming (class structure)
- String and line parsing with `getline()` and delimiters
- Control structures: `if`, `switch`, `while`
- Modular design using class methods

---

## 🛠️ How It Works

- Data is stored in `loginData.txt` in the format:
